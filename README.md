Student Marks Predictor

This repository contains a Student Marks Prediction application built using Linear Regression.
The model predicts a student’s expected marks based on hours of study and previous academic performance.

The project demonstrates how a simple regression model can be used to analyze and predict educational outcomes.

📌 Project Overview

Predicting student marks helps understand the relationship between study habits and academic results.
This project uses supervised machine learning to model the impact of:

Hours of study

Previous marks

on final student performance.

Model Used
Linear Regression

Simple and interpretable regression model

Identifies linear relationships between inputs and output

Suitable for continuous value prediction such as marks

The model is trained on historical student data and used to predict future marks.
